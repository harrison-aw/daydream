I like building characters in 3.5e. I made a monstrosity in
Excel that allowed me to do the min-maxing my heart desires. Then I
ported it to Google sheets so that I could share. As it turns out, it
was a pain in the ass to develop and was hard to maintain. After copying
"New New New Character" to "New New New New Character", I began this
project.

Currently, I am working on representing the rules for 3.5e. My current
goal is to make an automated number adder and list creator. Almost all
of the rules amount to adding something to a "list" or adding up numbers
in a particular way.

Ultimately, I want to add a way to persist a character and add a GUI to
allow efficient updating of a character build.
